# MyPortfolio

## Description / Motivation

This is the portfolio for Ian Gurgoze. It is made to make it easy to assess the work by me, I am hoping to use this for future employers to see this as a side to my resume. This
project taught me a lot about dealing with CSS and HTML and I hope to come back to this project many times to improve it as I learn more.
